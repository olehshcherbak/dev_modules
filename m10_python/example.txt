Processing and Planning Consequences

The depends_on meta-argument instructs Terraform to complete all actions on the dependency object
(including Read actions) before performing actions on the object declaring the dependency.
When the dependency object is an entire module, depends_on affects the order in which Terraform
processes all of the resources and data sources associated with that module. Refer to Resource
Dependencies and Data Resource Dependencies for more details.

You should use depends_on as a last resort because it can cause Terraform to create more conservative
plans that replace more resources than necessary. For example, Terraform may treat more values as unknown
“(known after apply)” because it is uncertain what changes will occur on the upstream object. This is e
specially likely when you use depends_on for modules.

Instead of depends_on, we recommend using expression references to imply dependencies when possible.
Expression references let Terraform understand which value the reference derives from and avoid planning
changes if that particular value hasn’t changed, even if other parts of the upstream object have planned changes.
